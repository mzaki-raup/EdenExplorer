# EdenExplorer Screenshots

All screenshots were taken with sample data (the `Eden Demo` folder: photos, a small website project, a Rust project, invoices, music, a font, and an archive). The Performance panel shots use `C:\Windows\System32` so the benchmark has a few hundred entries to list. Every screenshot shows the current layout: the address bar on its own row above the toolbar, and the status bar with selection size, free space, and the active filter.

## Walkthrough

![EdenExplorer walkthrough](eden-explorer-walkthrough.gif)

Opening the website project in Details + Preview and previewing a Markdown file with a Mermaid diagram, an SVG, and a Python file, jumping back with the address bar breadcrumbs, searching for "invoice", browsing Photos in Gallery and Details + Preview, then opening Settings > Toolbar.

## Analyze Disk Usage

![Analyze Disk Usage](disk-usage.gif)

Right-click the background of a folder > Analyze Disk Usage…, then a tour of the dashboard's tabs: Overview, the Folder Tree with share-of-parent bars, the cushion-shaded Treemap (hovering a block shows its path and size), the Sunburst, File Types, then Duplicates (Find Duplicates, then Keep Oldest marks the extra copies) and Clean Up measuring temp files, caches, the Recycle Bin, and old Downloads.

## Performance Panel Benchmarks

![Performance panel benchmark](performance-benchmark.gif)

Pressing Ctrl+K to open the panel, choosing 3 runs and clicking Benchmark This Folder (each listing method timed, the fastest highlighted), then switching to Benchmark This Drive and running it with a 64 MB test file: sequential and random 4K read/write, phase by phase, ending in MB/s and IOPS bars, measured with the Windows cache bypassed.

## Animated GIF Preview Controls

![Animated GIF preview controls](gif-preview-controls.gif)

Playing, pausing, stepping forward and back a frame, dragging the seek bar, stopping (back to frame 1), and playing again.

## Selection Tools And New File Templates

![Selection tools and New File templates](selection-and-templates.gif)

Select By Pattern (Ctrl+Shift+S) selecting `*.txt`, Invert Selection (Ctrl+I), then right-click > New File > Word Document (.docx), which goes straight into rename.

## Quick Look

![Quick Look](quick-look.gif)

Selecting a photo and pressing Space opens Quick Look over the window; ↓ and → step through the folder (an animated GIF plays with its controls), Space closes it, then Quick Look on a folder shows its item count and Esc closes it.

## Command Palette

![Command palette](command-palette.gif)

Ctrl+Shift+P, then typing `pho` to find the Photos folder, `gal` switches to the Gallery view, `det` back to Details, and `setbeh` opens Settings on the Behavior page.

## Archives

![Extracting and browsing archives](archives.gif)

Right-click a zip > Extract To "Holiday Photos\\" (progress in the notifications panel, then the new folder is selected), then double-click the zip to browse it like a folder: into Beach, Gallery thumbnails straight from the archive, Quick Look on a photo, and back out with the breadcrumbs.

## Archive Previews With VS Code File Icons

![Archive preview with file icons](archive-preview.gif)

Selecting a zip shows its contents in the preview pane, inside the rounded preview frame, as a tree with Material Icon Theme icons (as in VS Code): collapsing src and node_modules, Collapse All, opening the top folder and docs, Expand All, then the same for a tar.gz, in the dark and light themes.

## Queued And Verified Copies

![Queued and verified copies](transfers.gif)

Copying a 180 MB folder to Documents and then to Desktop: the second copy waits as "Queued #1" (with sooner/later/cancel buttons and Pause All in the header) until the first finishes, and with Verify Copies on each one ends with "Verified 3 files".

## Breadcrumb Folder Menus

![Breadcrumb folder menus](breadcrumbs.gif)

From Photos, the arrow after Eden Demo lists its folders (Photos highlighted) and Music is picked; the arrow after Documents shows Eden Demo on the path; then Eden Demo > Projects, and the arrow at the end lists Projects' own folders to open rust-app.

## Terminal Pane

![Terminal pane](terminal.gif)

Ctrl+` opens the pane with the default shell (PowerShell 7 with an Oh My Posh-style prompt, its icons from the automatically chosen Nerd Font); dragging the top edge makes it taller; the + menu lists every installed shell and starts Ubuntu (WSL) in a second session tab; switching tabs, then Ctrl+` hides the pane and the toolbar's Terminal Pane button brings it back with both shells still there. Both are live shells running the commands shown.

## Sidebar Folders Tree

![Sidebar Folders tree](folder-tree.gif)

Opened in Eden Demo, the tree is already expanded down to it; the arrows expand Eden Demo and Projects, clicking website opens it, clicking Documents in the address bar moves the highlight back up the tree, and right-clicking a folder shows Open In New Tab, Analyze Disk Usage, and Collapse All.

## Filter Bar Options

![Filter bar options](filter-bar.gif)

Ctrl+Shift+F opens the filter box: `app` filters by text, `*.json; *.md` by wildcards, then the `.*` button switches to a regular expression - the box turns red while `\.(py` is incomplete (the view shows the error), `\.(py|html)$` matches, and Hide Matches shows everything else. Without text, the Code and Documents chips show only that kind of file.

## Spring-Loaded Folders

![Spring-loaded folders](spring-loaded-folders.gif)

Dragging Meeting Notes.txt: resting on Projects opens it, resting on Eden Demo in the address bar goes back up, and resting on Projects in the sidebar's Folders tree expands it.

## Flat View

![Flat view](flat-view.gif)

The toolbar's Flat View button lists every file under Eden Demo as one list with a Folder column, and clicking that header sorts by folder; in the website project (a Git repository) Flat View keeps the Git letters and dims the ignored build output; the status bar's × goes back to the normal view.

## Git Status

![Git status](git-status.gif)

In a Git repository: M on modified and staged files, U on untracked ones, ignored files dimmed, and the branch with the number of changes in the status bar. Editing README.md outside the app and refreshing marks it M; a new docs folder shows U; hovering the status bar shows the repository.

## Remote Locations

![Remote locations](remote-locations.gif)

Team Server, an SFTP location in the sidebar, opens like a folder; selecting beach.png in Photos previews it from a downloaded copy, and Copy then Paste in Downloads downloads it, with the progress in the notifications.

## WSL Layout

![WSL layout](wsl-layout.gif)

Clicking Ubuntu in the sidebar's Linux section opens the distribution's files with its shell beside them; the address bar shows Ubuntu instead of `\\wsl$\Ubuntu`.
